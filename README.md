# GEhack2015
Remote area worker safety app UI concept for GEhack2015 industrial hackathon, 28-29 November 2015

This is an AnguarJS project based on the Maps template of the Ionic framework (http://ionicframework.com/).

To run this project, install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/), then using the Node Package Manager, 
install Cordova and Ionic, as described at http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/. This page also
shows how to install iOS and Android platform support, so that you can run the app on a physical device
and access the device hardware if desired.

Ionic's Creator UI (https://creator.ionic.io/) is a good visual way to create the skeleton of a mobile app, though it doesn't currently support the Maps starter template, which the command line interface does.

The initial version of this project was created using the command:

  `ionic start directory_name maps`

To run the project, go to the Terminal or command line, change to the project root directory, and execute the command:

  `ionic serve`
  
This should open a browser window at localhost:8100, where you should see a map of a rather hazard-filled North Sydney :-)
